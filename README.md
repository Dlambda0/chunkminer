### The Chunkminer
---

Have you ever wanted to remove a chunk or a portion from your survival minecraft world? Do you have a life outside of mining for stone for a castle? the chunkminer will do so in place of you!

you will be able to specify height, length, and width of what you will like to mine out of your minecraft world.

this is my first project, so all every line of code made in this repository is not reflective of my current skill and ability

I may plan on reprogramming this in C/C++ at some point; but for now, this will remain as a python script

Texture packs are not supported and are unlikely to recieve it due to how the project is coded.

Dedicated to the man who sold the world
